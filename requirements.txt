Project Assignment: PDF Transaction Extraction & Web UI
Deadline: 10 days from project kick-off. Please submit your GitHub repo link by end of day.
 Objective
Build a full-stack solution to ingest, parse, translate and store 30 years of Tamil real-estate 
transactions from a PDF into a PostgreSQL database, and present them in a searchable web UI.
 Scope of Work
1. PDF Ingestion & Parsing
o Accept a Tamil-language PDF containing real-estate transactions for a single survey (APP_8400001_TXN_418613175_TMPLT_8400004.pdf)
number/district.
o Extract each transaction’s fields (e.g. buyer, seller, house no., survey no., document 
no., date, value).
2. Translation
o Translate Tamil fields to English, preserving accuracy of names and document 
references.
3. Filtering & Search
o Support query parameters: buyer name, seller name, house number, survey number, 
document number.
o Return only matching transactions in JSON.
4. API Development
o Build a POST endpoint using Node.js, Nest.js and Drizzle ORM:
▪ Accepts PDF upload
▪ Parses, translates, filters, and writes transactions into PostgreSQL
▪ Returns inserted records as JSON.
5. Web UI
o Use Next.js + Tailwind CSS to build a simple interface:
▪ Login screen (stub authentication is acceptable)
▪ PDF upload form
▪ Results table showing inserted transactions
▪ PDF preview panel alongside the table for side-by-side comparison.
6. Libraries & Tools
o You may use any free, open-source libraries 
o Store secrets/config in environment variables.
 Deliverables
• GitHub repository containing all source code.
• README.md detailing:
o Setup & run instructions
o Assumptions made (e.g., PDF layout variations)
o Architectural overview & chosen libraries
• Database schema (Drizzle migrations or SQL).
• Demo credentials (for UI login stub).
 Evaluation Criteria
• Correctness: Accurate extraction and translation of all transactions.
• Code Quality: Clean architecture, modular code, meaningful variable names, comments.
• User Experience: Intuitive UI for upload, preview, and results.
• Performance: Reasonable processing time for a 30-year PDF.
• Documentation: Clear README, schema diagrams, and setup steps.
